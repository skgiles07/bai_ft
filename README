Step 1: Set Up Your Google Colab Environment
Open Google Colab:
Go to Google Colab and create a new notebook.

Install the Necessary Libraries:
In the first cell of your notebook, install the required libraries by running the following:

!pip install transformers peft datasets accelerate huggingface_hub

This will install the transformers, peft (Low-Rank Adapters for efficient fine-tuning), datasets (to handle datasets), and huggingface_hub (for Hugging Face interaction) libraries.
